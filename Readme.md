# Lamda parser and reducer

This project was made for training purposes. It parses lambda expression to tree of operations and variables.
Operations are abstraction (\x.y) and application (a b). Variables are strings of [a-z] charachters. 

Operations available:
* print - represents expression as a string
* tree - represents expression as a tree
* reduce - reduces expression and gives number of reduces
* steps - step-by-step reducing
* . - do last inputted command
* 'command' . - do command with last inputted expression
* exit - close the programm
